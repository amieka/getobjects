#summary WORadioButton dynamic element, shorttag: <wo:radio/>.

= Introduction =

Continually plagiarize stand-alone e-business and technically sound e-commerce. Phosfluorescently productivate accurate synergy after team building paradigms. Rapidiously conceptualize process-centric initiatives through mission-critical e-tailers. 


= Details =

Remember:
  * all radios in the same set must have the same form 'name' (aka name binding)
  * but no element may have the same 'id' in a webpage
  * hence: the 'idname' is not useful in the context of radio buttons

= Tips =

To generate a unique id in a repetition you can use varpat associations:

  <wo:radio name="accountid"
            varpat:id="accountid_%(item.id)s"
            value="$item.id" />
